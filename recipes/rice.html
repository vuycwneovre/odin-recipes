    <p>What would we do without rice? Most cuisines of the world are cooking rice in one way or another - 
        from sushi to arroz con pollo, rice puddings to paella, and dolmas to dirty rice and jambalaya. 
        We're also drinking our fair share of rice - in sake, horchata, rice milk, and even beer. 
        All told, we humans get more than 20% of our calories from this small but mighty grain.
